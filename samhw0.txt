       The first report from 100 Years of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides an overview of the likely effects of advances in AI across many different domains over the next decade. It extols many of the "benefits" of AI but seems to only lightly touch on its largest drawback: the economic disenfranchisement of large swathes of working people. While the authors talk extensively about “overcoming fear” of job loss due to automation, they offer little consolation. Attempting to pacify the fearful public, they argue that many of the jobs will not be entirely replaced, AI instead will be “replacing tasks”. What they do not mention is that as AI incrementally takes over tasks, these new jobs will require higher levels of education, training, and preparation, all of which might not be accessible to those in need of employment. 
       According to The World Economic Forum (1), widespread workplace adoption of AI may create as many as 133 million jobs by 2022 but it also may displace as many as 75 million jobs in the same time frame. While that seems like a net gain of many jobs, the nature of these jobs is yet unknown. What is sure, is that these jobs will require more education. Pew Research analyzed over 950 different occupations cataloged by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Information Network from 1980-2015 and found that jobs are requiring more and more education and skills. The need for Analytical skills alone grew 77% compared to the need for Physical skills at 18%. Working with technology is cited as one of the main contributing factors (2). 
       With skill requirements for new jobs going up and up and large job displacement on the horizon, education is a must.  Educational disparities across different demographics are widely studied and may be increasing. Between 2001-2012, the educational funding gap between rich and poor schools grew 44% (3). Without an equitable distribution of educational resources, we are poised to deepen that divide. The McKinsey Global Institute issued a report on the impact of AI on the world economy in 2018, outlining that, if the deployment of the technology is not managed effectively, “inequality could deepen, fueling conflict within societies.”(4)
       Those who have access to education, the economic resources to survive the transition or can learn a whole new career on short notice may pivot careers more easily. But this will exclude many people, and rising societal inequity seems all but a guarantee. The report does acknowledge this in the end of the employment section saying that in the long-term, “current social safety nets may need to evolve into better social services for everyone” and that “everyone should be entitled to a portion of the world’s AI-produced treasure.”
       Universal basic income (UBI) and its variants have been increasing in popularity for the last decade. Now, it has been thrust into the spotlight by the former presidential candidate Andrew Yang and the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much is still unknown about UBI (Basic Income source, 2020), it remains one of the only suggestions to combat the long-term effects of automation on work-force participation. As the pace of work-place integration of AI accelerates, economic and educational outcomes are likely to be incomplete and disparate, deepening further the existing fissures embedded in our society. Over the coming decades, AI will test the agility and durability of our societal and governmental institutions. Hopefully, they are intelligent enough to pass the test.
